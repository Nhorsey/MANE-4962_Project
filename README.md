# MANE-4962 Project: Predictive Maintenence Using Machine Learning
## What is this project?
As part of the spring 2024 semester MANE-4962 Machine Learning for Engineering course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, students are tasked with applying the material learned in the course to a real-world problem. 
This project addressses the topic of predictive maintenance for use in industrial applications. Predictive maintenance is the practice of using historical data of machinery operating characteristics and failures, and training a ML model to predict how and when machinery will fail in the future, based on the machine's operating parameters. This project relies heavily on existing research into the application of ML in predictive maintenance, and will implement several different ML techniques, and compare their efficacy. The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset, a synthetic representation of machinery operating parameters and failures seen in industry.
